    "This project attempts to address a major challenge for UCSD students: deciding which classes to enroll in during first and second pass. UCSD’s unique “pass” enrollment system turns course selection into more of an art than a science, often leaving students uncertain about their choices or failing to enroll in certain classes. This process also involves other unusual factors, such as major priority for CSE courses. Overall, there is a definite need for a tool that maximizes students' chances of securing their desired courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon initial research, we came across a research paper on using Machine Learning Methods for Course Enrollment Prediction <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) at San Diego State University. Their primary focus was to predict course enrollment rates based on demographic and academic performance data. Although these variables are not an element of our research, their methodology with student data is applicable. For example, they considered generic variables like major and prerequisites, and incorporated predictive models like classification and regression trees. Therefore, we can build on this analysis with similar ML and statistical approaches that consider more course and student-specific factors, such as the ones mentioned in the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found two projects directly related to UCSD enrollment. This project collects data on individual classes at different points in time during each term, such as Fall 2022 or Winter 2023; each term’s data is contained within its own repository <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The project involved building a web scraping tool that scrapes web-reg about every 10 minutes and collects real-time data on information like enrolled, available, and waitlist spots. This not only offers a tool to collect our data in the future but also a great sample dataset from what has already been collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second project was built using the aforementioned GitHub repositories  <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Given a course, the website takes data from specific terms and plots the course availability as a time series across various registration milestones (senior first pass, junior second pass, etc). This offers a great initial visualization of the enrollment data, and our EDA would likely produce some similar graphs. However, our objective is to quantify the relationship between student/course factors and course availability and use our analysis to develop a recommendation system that helps students prioritize courses for first and second pass. Additionally, we plan on conducting our research on data collected across 11 quarters as compared to only one quarter shown in the stated project. We believe this is significant because there may exist quarterly patterns for some classes that a single quarter would fail to grasp.\n",

    "We predict that a course’s fill rate and student class standing would be the most influential combination of factors for students deciding on courses to enroll in and directly influence the number of open seats remaining during first and second pass. More specifically, we predict that courses with a higher fill rate and later enrollment period (due to higher class standing) would mean there are fewer seats available, and thus more likely to reach full capacity during first pass rather than second pass."

    "### Dataset Structure and Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCSD Historical Enrollment Data is systematically organized within a GitHub repository, where each academic term is represented by a dedicated repository. This structure facilitates easy access to term-specific enrollment data. The data collection process is such that it captures enrollment statistics at regular intervals, providing a detailed view of how course enrollment evolves throughout the registration period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The granularity of the data collection, which is approximately every 10 minutes during active enrollment periods, offers in depth insight into enrollment patterns, though for the purpose of our analysis, we will be implementing a more manageable sampling frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality and Completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset encompasses all undergraduate courses offered at UC San Diego across eleven quarters, providing a comprehensive view of enrollment patterns. While the number of observations varies between courses and quarters—primarily due to differences in course offerings and enrollment period durations — the consistency in variable recording ensures data compatibility across all terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Considerations\n",
    "For our analysis, several key processing steps will be implemented:\n",
    "1. Temporal aggregation to reduce unnecessary granularity while maintaining ensuring the trend of the data is captured accurately\n",
    "2. Consistency of course codes to enable cross-quarter analysis\n",
    "3. Enrollment phase demarcations (first pass, second pass, waitlist periods)\n",
    "4. Creation of derived metrics such as fill rates to enhance analysis capabilities\n",
    "5. Assignment of class standings (First-Year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) to reflect enrollment priority hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset serves as an invaluable resource for understanding UC San Diego's enrollment patterns, offering insights that can inform both administrative decision-making and student course planning strategies."

    "The initial approach to data collection from GitHub appeared straightforward, utilizing the pandas' read_csv() method to access the datasets hosted on GitHub. However, the extensive scope of the dataset—encompassing thousands of subjects with multiple observations across eleven academic quarters rendered this method inefficient, with projected data retrieval times exceeding twelve hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance performance, we implemented several optimization strategies. First, we employed the chunking mechanism within read_csv() to process data in segments. While this modification yielded some improvement in processing speed, the enhancement was marginal for our requirements. Furthermore, we encountered limitations imposed by GitHub's API rate restrictions.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "To address these constraints, we implemented parallel processing using the concurrent.futures package, enabling simultaneous retrieval of multiple files. This significantly improved operational efficiency<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup>. Additionally, we found that GitHub's API authentication system offered substantially higher rate limits, 5,000 requests per hour, for authenticated users compared to 60 for unauthenticated users. Therefore we implementated authentication headers in our requests to effectively circumvent the restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequent challenge emerged regarding data completeness. Our initial API implementation for retrieving directory contents was subject to GitHub's truncation limit of 999 files per directory, resulting in incomplete data collection. Through further research, we identified that the git/trees API provided access to the complete file directory, including previously truncated entries. This solution ensured we collected complete data<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize computational efficiency and eliminate redundant processing, we stored the collected data in enrollment_data.csv. The presence of this file in the working directory enables the system to skip the data collection process during subsequent notebook kernel restarts.\n",

    "While the data is openly accessible, the method of data collection raises ethical considerations regarding automated data retrieval. It is essential to ensure that the scraping process does not access data we are not meant to use. However, the github uses the MIT License, and mentions that anyone is free to use this data. Since this repository is the only thing we scrape, we can address ethical concerns by simply citing this repository as our data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the data has no personally identifiable information (PII), there are some other privacy considerations. For example, enrollment trends and course availability data may indirectly reflect departmental or institutional scheduling strategies. Care must be taken to ensure that any analysis or publication of findings does not inadvertently expose proprietary or sensitive academic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are potential biases in the datasets that may need to be addressed, particularly concerning data collection and representation. We may be analyzing data that has an overrepresentation of certain majors and class standings which leads to a biased analysis and recommendations. In addition to that, there may be subjective biases present in course and professor evaluations (CAPES) and instructor ratings from Rate My Professor. To identify and mitigate these biases, we will follow the Data Science Ethics Checklist. This includes conducting thorough data validation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementing access controls to ensure data security as well as integrity. We will ensure that our visualizations and reports honestly represent the data and transparently document our analysis process. Any identified issues will be addressed through corrective measures such as weighting adjustments for underrepresented groups and/or incorporating additional data sources. As we complete all these ethical and privacy concerns throughout our project, we will produce fair, unbiased, and equitable recommendations for future use. \n"
